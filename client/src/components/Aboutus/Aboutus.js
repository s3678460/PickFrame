                On the verge of the fourth industrial revolution,
                our main aim in this project is to build a online 
                marketplace where passionate photographers can be
                able to satisfy their demands by selling photos that
                are taken by them. In another aspect, small businesses
                have a chance to own licensed photos and use them 
                legally in any projects. Through that, PickFrame will be a useful
                tool to change customer behavior in which whenever you 
                run a business, owning something with a license is
                absolutely necessary for your business and the domestic market.

                Platform Goals (Service and Product outcomes)
                A platform to connect artists and businesses interested 
                in stock photos and illustrations. Thus, a minimal viable
                product for PickFrame should be where transactions can take 
                place easily and conveniently.
                As a website that provides licensed photos, security plays
                an important role for this project. Firstly, terms and 
                conditions to join our platform from contributors and 
                from who to buy our photos  have to be precisely legislated
                by us to make sure that is the only photo is used to sell 
                and contributors can not use it somewhere else. By the same 
                token with buyers, the website will demand the name of a
                company that owns photos, hence there is only that company
                can be able to use the photos. Secondly, administrators will take responsibility to manage all the contents which are posted on
                the website. Admin accounts will be given to each member of
                Oasis team and after the photos are uploaded by contributors,
                the photos will be processed in the system queue to wait for
                authorization and verification. Based on several given requirements, administrators will review and decide which photos match with
                all the requirements or which should be forbidden.
